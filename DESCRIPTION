Description: 
    Companion package to the study "LLM-Enhanced Sub-Ontology Development for Improved Interdisciplinary Discoverability in Scientific Investigation Methods and Tooling". 
    The library contains the R objects created and used in both studies described. 
    A script to accurately reproduce the research objects is provided, and the functions used are made available as R functions via the library.
    Besides the data objects, the library includes the classes, requests, processing, and reporting functions, rewritten to be reusable in novel studies of the same type.
    Finally, a composite dataset from all metrics in the study is distributed with the library, and the vignettes and examples will reproduce the two studies of the paper, adhering to the objectives of open and reproducible research.
    More information about the paper and library, can be found in the repository's wiki.
    This study was conducted in partial completion of Ms. Maratsi's grant "Towards a sustainable Open Data ECOsystem (ODECO)", Grant Agreement Number: 955569. An early prototype of this work was in completion of an "ODECO Secondments" agreement, between the University of the Aegean, and the Greek Free Open Source Software (https://mathe.ellak.gr).
    The package name quotes Leon Kimbro: It refers to the pitfall of an Absolute Cosmic Eternal Perfect Ontological System, from the essay _How to make a complete map of every thought you think_ (2003).
